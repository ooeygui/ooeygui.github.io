I updated the Arduino plugin with the following features:




- ATMega328 support


- Arduino programming model (setup/loop instead of main)


- Support for pde files (which are just C++ source files)








[Download link](Arduino.tmplugin.zip)




Let me know if you have any issues. (or send a quick note to say you use it)
