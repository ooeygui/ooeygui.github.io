I was discussing the prospect of "home fabricators" with aÂ reluctantÂ friend of mine recently. The idea that a "3D printer" would be as ubiquitous as Microwave ovens in 10 years may seem far fetched. I likened the hobbyist nature of home fabs today to the garage computers of the '70s. The device I'm building is like "Lego meets the Easy Bake Oven".One of the oft mentioned complaints of using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) for toys is that you end up with a highly aliased volume - it has ridges. And while ridges are fine for potato chips, they aren't very good for toys; or so they say. Â The smallest of Â Lego have a dimension of about an eighth inch - an order ofÂ magnitudeÂ larger than an FDM modeler.
