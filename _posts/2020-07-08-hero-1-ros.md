When I was young - early '80s - I was in the boy scouts. During one of our events, one of the parents introduced us to a Heathkit Hero 1. It was the first time I realized Robots were real.

I found a complete Hero 1 robot on eBay, and had to have it!  It has sat on a a shelf for over a year now. I was recently inspired by a restoration video to fix it up.

Through the grapevine, I was introduced to a Robotics historian, who has a cache of components - and upgrades! 

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to be doing a teardown, cleanup and rebuild... I'll post progress shots. Maybe even do videos...

If you are reading this - cool. It's been forever since I posted.

I work professionally with the Robot Operating System - ROS.... Once it is up and running - maybe I'll ROS enable it.

Because.
