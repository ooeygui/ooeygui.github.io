Through the kindness of their heart, [PSM North America](http://www.psmna.com/) has provided me with a small quantity of Polystarch plastic. Polystarch plastic is made with a biodegradable resin made from corn starch. It has most of the same qualities of petrochemical based plastics, but will compost completely very quickly.

Currently, I have it in granule form. One of the options I've been looking into is an extruder which can source granules instead of filament.
