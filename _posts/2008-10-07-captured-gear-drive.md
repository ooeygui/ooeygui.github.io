During the Seattle robotics meeting, I 'crossed the streams' (reverse polarity) and destroyed the motor controller (and presumably the motor, don't want to take changes). Given that I wanted to standardize on the 12v motors I was using for the Axis, this seemed like a good time to incorporate this motor into the extruder.  �



While building the new motor mount, I decided to look into a different type of extruder drive, similar to the pinch pulley, but built with gears. Two drive gears have a 1/8 channel milled into them. The gears with the channel 'capture' and hold the plastic cord. I wasn't sure how long the  �urethane  �pulley would last, so this is an experiment.
