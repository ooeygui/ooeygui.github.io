Fabr v2 uses a moving platform for the Z axis. This means it has a maximum volume is quite difficult to change. The platform requires a significant number of moving parts. I had been wondering if I could change fabr so that one axis could be changed out...


For Fabr v3, I wanted to see if I could replace the Y axis with a replaceable platform, driven by an edge motor. With this arrangement, I could replace the platform with any length I needed for the job at hand. I'm not quite sure if this will work, but something I've been thinking about.
