  �![Voxel](/assets/images/2008/03/voxels.png) The voxel generator is complete. I spent quite a bit of time attempting to use Sketchup's intersection APIs in order to build voxels; only to discover that Sketchup doesn't maintain volume information - just edge information.The current implementation of the voxel generator uses a guillotine to slice the model into layers. For each apparent voxel, it uses a line crossing point-in-polygon algorithm to determine if the voxel is set. This code doesn't handle curves yet - sketchup represents curves differently than simple edges.My next step is build composers - which walk the voxels to generate specific objects. These will be used to generate layer commands which will be sent to the motor controller.
