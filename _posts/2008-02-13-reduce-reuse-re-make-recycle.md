In other words:Louie: 1Toaster: 0In the beginning of Jimmy Neutron, little Jim launches aÂ satellite made from his mother's toaster. I couldn't help but think of the boyÂ geniusÂ as I disassembled a toaster, in order to obtain the vital element to my printer's extruder head. Â BuriedÂ in the heart of the beast - a twisted network of sheet metal delicately twisted together by an underpaid worker in aÂ foreignÂ land, lay the prize - several feet of Nichrome wire.Â WhileÂ therapeutic, the disassembly of the toaster had a lasting impression upon me. The toaster isn't directly recyclable, yet when I was finished my disassembly I had reduced it to electronics components and wires I could use and sheet metal - which can be directly recycled. While I did end up with some plastic components which could not be identified for recycling, these were put into my chipper box for later reduction to granules - and hopeful later identification.(I love Jack Johnson's music.)
