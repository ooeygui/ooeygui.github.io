Things are finally starting to get real. Time for some progress photos!

## Structure
I ordered a bunch of components from the 8020 garage sale on eBay. I had opted for plastic end joins, and 3 linear motion bearings. The bearings were very expensive, so I may look for something different in the future.

## Extruder Barrel
I spent a few hours on the extruder this past weekend. Was able to construct the head, heater barrel, and motor mount.  �I picked up the parts from from the plumbing isle - 4" brass barrel, coupler, and an square end stop.   �I filed the end stop down to a pyramid, and drilled out the inside to reduce the amount of material I needed to punch through with the small bit. In hind sight, I should have hand drilled the extruder hole as 500 rpm was too much for the tiny drill bits - I broke 3 on the attempt. I coated the barrel and coupler with a high temp enamel finish in order to prevent the nichrome wire from shorting out to the barrel.


Here's the result:

I also received some HDPE cord from Village Plastics.Here's 5 lbs:
