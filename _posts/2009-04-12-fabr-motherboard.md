"I love it when a plan comes together"


The Fabr motherboard is complete, and the [firmware refactor](http://reprap.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/reprap/trunk/users/lamadio/FirmwareRefactorPrep/main/) I've been working on is ready for testing.


Here are some glamor shots of the motherboard (which are reprap firmware and connector compatible, just in case).

Hoping to have this thing up and running for the Robotics meeting this weekend.
