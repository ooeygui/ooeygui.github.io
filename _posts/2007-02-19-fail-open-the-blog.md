A previous blog post on "Fail open" talked about anticipating failure conditions and doing the most secure thing by default. It was a muse I had on the way to work one day. It turns out that my friend Jeff has a particular interest in this topic, and started a blog. I think this is going to be a great one to watch - [http://paranoidcoder.com/](http://paranoidcoder.com/). 

Good luck Jeff, I look forward to your posts.
