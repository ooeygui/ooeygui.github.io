Just some quick notes: 

Fabr will be at the Seattle Robotics meeting on September 20th. For more information about the meeting, visit [http://www.seattlerobotics.org/](http://www.seattlerobotics.org/).

I've been posting updates to my twitter feed instead of posting incremental updates. You can follow me via [http://twitter.com/ooeygui](http://twitter.com/ooeygui).

I am working on a couple of major changes to the RepRap driver software, a post about using Programming Patterns with the Arduino, and more about the Fabr extruder. Stay tuned...
