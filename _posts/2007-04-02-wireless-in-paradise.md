It's nearly midnight, and I'm lounging on a beach chair by the rocky protected diver cove at [Sunset house](http://www.sunsethouse.com/) on the island of Grand Cayman. The dive gear is prepped and Kathy is asleep, but I couldn't help but sit here and post...  It has been quite a month - the last thing on my mind was the blog. I finally have some time to update it.

It's been one of those months where life seems to be conspiring against you - Everything seeming to come at you at once. We have seen it all - births, deaths, taxes, surgeries, emergencies, fire drills (literal and figurative), house problems... We've also had quite a bit of good stuff too - family photographs, visits with friends, friends moving into town, and my parents & brother came to visit.

The last few days have been really calm  - we're on vacation celebrating 5 years of marriage.  (Thanks mom & dad for sitting for the kids so we can have a vacation!)

I look forward to diving with my wife. Relaxing. And doing some introspection as I contemplate the "grand master plan".

I've been trying to write some technical posts for the last few weeks - Centering around CoreFoundation & CoreGraphics. I seem to be going nowhere fast on those posts. Hopefully I'll have something soon.

Anyway, off to bed.
