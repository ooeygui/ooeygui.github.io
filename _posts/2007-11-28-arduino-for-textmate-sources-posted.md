There's been lots of interest in the TextMate plugin. I'm positing the sources in order to enable people to improve the code and share it back. The code is quick and dirty.If you make modifications, please send me a patch - feedback at ooeygui.com.You can check out the sources using Subversion:Â ```
svn co https://ooeygui.com/Arduino .
