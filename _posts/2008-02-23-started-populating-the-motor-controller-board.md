I received my order from Batch PCB today. After the boys went to bed, I started populating the board. This is my first board using surface mounted components. The variable resistors turned out to be the hardest - they have 3 points of contact. I didn't label the capacitors or resistors, so I'll need to print out a guide when I put those in.
