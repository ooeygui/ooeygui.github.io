My son and I put together the z-axis today. Watching a 4 year old use a hack saw was  �amusing - I kept it safe and he felt like it was the best thing in the whole world.


The elevator is supported by 4 screws, using flanged nuts connected by L shaped aluminum extrusions. The screws float between the upper and lower cross beams - RC car bearings  �prevent them from binding. Sprockets and chain from Electric gold mine tie it together.   �In order to tension the chain, I added an additional sprocket which I can move along another crossbar.   �I designed the z-axis so that I can replace the print surface.  �
