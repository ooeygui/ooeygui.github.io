My workshop is in the garage - an uninsulated and unheated area. Currently the workshop is too cold to work comfortably or safely (I don't want to get wrapped up in the lathe while wearing a ski jacket).



I've been looking into an electric heating and cooling solution. I haven't found anything that can cover the whole workshop area of about 1,000sft. Most portable heating and air conditioning units top out at about 400 sqft. Either I need to partition the area, or look into something that will work over the whole area - maybe a heat pump for a small house or condo. It would also be nice if I can wall mount it, so I don't take shop floor space...  �



Got any suggestions?
