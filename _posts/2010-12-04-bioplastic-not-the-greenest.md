I wrote an article a long time ago where I tried to determine which was better ['Bioplastic' or 'Petroplastic'](https://ooeygui.com/?p=83).

[Ecogeek has a post](http://www.ecogeek.org/alternative-materials/3362-bioplastics-not-necessarily-the-greenest) about the same thing - and drew similar conclusions. Worth the read.
