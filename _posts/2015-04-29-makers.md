For the past year, I've been a developer in the Windows Maker team at Microsoft. The Maker team represents Makers within Microsoft; ensuring that Microsoft products have the capabilities that Makers want. We bring Microsoft technologies to the Maker community, through demonstrations - documentation, samples, and projects.

The [Windows Developer Program for IoT](http://ms-iot.github.io/content) - a version of Windows 8.1 for the Intel Galileo - was the first big project to come out of Windows specifically for Makers, and was collaboration between the Maker team and the Windows Embedded team. 

[WindowsOnDevices.com](http://WindowsOnDevices.com) is out launch point for our Maker engagement.

With Windows 10, many of the learnings of the developer program are coming to light. I can't wait to play - both professionally and personally...

What am I going to build? What are you going to build?
