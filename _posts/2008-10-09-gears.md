I've always loved gears. Who doesn't?  Since getting the lathe and mill, I couldn't wait to try to make gears. Slowly, over the last year, I've acquired the components to make a gear - from the rotary table, the angle plate, the gear cutters, the arbor, the threading attachment so I could make a gear cutting mandrel... I was finally able to make my first set of gears:

These will eventually be the cord engagement gears. I need to mill the 1/8 grove which will capture the cord.




I had much less luck with the smaller pinion gear:

As you can see the teeth aren't formed correctly. This is actually the 3rd attempt. On my first attempt I accidentally attempted to cut 24 teeth instead of the 13 I was shooting for. I decided the second attempt to cut 12 teeth because it divided cleanly, but forgot to adjust the blank diameter. The third attempt, it looks like I forgot to center the cutter, so it is off... Too late to start a new blank, so left for another night.




For kicks, here's my gear cutting setup:
