# Lou Amadio — Principal Architect of Interactive Worlds

Welcome to the portfolio of an engineer who has literally shaped the digital landscape for three decades—from the foundations of the modern web to the frontiers of AI-driven mixed reality.

## The Epoch Spanning Career

**29 years building the future.** Not following roadmaps. Writing them.

### The Foundation Era (1997-2006) — *Architecting the OS at Microsoft*

Before the cloud. Before smartphones. Before most engineers were born, Lou was laying the architectural groundwork for modern computing:

- **Internet Explorer 4 & 5** — Core UI component architecture
- **Windows 2000, XP, Vista** — Principal engineer on UI frameworks that billions of users would interface with
- **Windows XP Media Center Edition** — Pioneering living room computing

*These weren't minor features. These were the technologies that defined an era of personal computing.*

### The Safari Manifesto (2006-2007) — *Technical Lead, Apple*

Handpicked to bridge worlds: Ported **WebKit, WebCore, JavaScriptCore, CFNetwork, CoreGraphics, and CoreFoundation** to Windows for Safari. Architected the control framework that made Windows components feel like macOS. Assisted iPhone and iTunes teams.

*At Apple, among the architects of modern web browsers.*

### The Social Graph Era (2007-2009) — *Chief Architect, Yahoo*

While Internet infrastructure crumbled, Lou engineered the systems that connected humanity:

- Designed the **Yahoo Open Strategy "Social Graph"** — mining vast seas of data from Yahoo properties
- Built machine learning components trained on 2.5+ million users' activity
- Architected **Yahoo Web Services** framework coordinating development across Sunnyvale, Bellevue, and Bangalore
- Engineered **Dimension** — a multi-platform 3D UI runtime with declarative composition, delegation behaviors, and smooth video playback on separate render threads

*Chief Architect of social connection at internet scale.*

### The Return to Microsoft — The Roboticist Era (2009-2023)

Rejoined Microsoft and systematically conquered every domain:

**Phase 1: Gaming & Telepresence (2009-2014)**
- Led team of 4 for **Windows Phone 7 Game Hub** — end-to-end architecture from game to cloud for Xbox Live services
- **Skype Incubation Group**: High-definition video composition pipelines, motion control hardware/firmware, USB 3.0 imaging devices

**Phase 2: Robotics (2011-2023)**
- **Microsoft Robotics (2011-2013)** — Components for Developer Studio, heterogeneous computing for vision/media
- **IoT Pioneer (2014-2016)** — Led the **Windows Maker Team**: productized Windows Developer Preview for IoT, open-sourced the program, implemented Arduino-compatible APIs for Intel Galileo, drove Windows 10 for Raspberry Pi
- **IoT Architect (2016-2019)** — Principal Software Architect for Windows 10 IoT Core and Enterprise with specialization in Robotics and Industrial Automation
- **Azure Edge Robotics (2019-2022)** — Led engineering scrum team building safe, secure, manageable robotics solutions using ROS with Microsoft technologies
- **Advanced Autonomy and Applied Robotics (2022-2023)** — Principal Software Architect enabling safe, scalable robotics that interoperate everywhere
  - Contributions to ROS2 Technical Steering Committee (Open Robotics)
  - Representation in ROS Industrial Consortium
  - Maintained ROS on Windows
  - VS Code ROS extension development

### The AI Frontier (2023-Present)

- **Discovery & Quantum, Office of the CTO (2023-2025)** — Developed the **Multi-agent AI Runtime** powering Microsoft Discovery. Expertise: distributed training, LLMs, generative AI, autonomous agents, and heterogeneous systems
- **Principal Software Engineering Lead - Mixed Reality (2025-Present)** — User experience team lead for Windows Mixed Reality. Leading the next frontier of human-computer interaction

## The Parallel Saga: The Maker's Odyssey

Since 2007, a relentless personal pursuit:

- **Fabr** — From hand-laid circuit boards to functional self-replicating 3D printer
- **Stepper Motor Drivers & Firmware** — Foundational to the RepRap ecosystem
- **Arduino for TextMate** — Democratized embedded systems development
- **Event-loop Architecture** — Design patterns that unified microcontroller systems

## The Architecture

30 years of relentless mastery across:
- **Systems Architecture** — From UI frameworks to distributed robotics to multi-agent AI systems
- **Hardware-Software Integration** — Microcontrollers to cloud infrastructure
- **Team Leadership** — Building teams that ship products billions use
- **Open Source Stewardship** — ROS ecosystem, robotics infrastructure, maker tools

## Why This Matters

Lou doesn't build things. Lou builds the **foundations** that others build things upon. Every domain entered has been elevated and systematized: web browsers, social networks, game infrastructure, robotics platforms, AI systems, mixed reality.

The pattern: Master the domain → Architect the foundations → Empower others → Move to the next frontier.

**The archive below spans nearly three decades.** Early posts document the maker's journey. Later entries capture the evolution toward multi-agent systems and immersive worlds.

This is not a portfolio of features shipped. This is a chronicle of the **systems, architectures, and platforms** that enabled entire categories of technology.

*To the relentless builders: the future isn't something that happens to you. It's something you architect.*
